    "A Chain is a reusable component that encodes a sequence of calls to other components (LLMs, retrievers, other chains, etc.), exposing a simple interface to run that sequence. Chains are designed to be stateful (can include Memory), observable (callbacks), and composable (can be combined with other chains). As an API concept, there’s a base Chain class and many specific chain implementations built on top of it. \n",
